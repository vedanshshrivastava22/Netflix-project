# Netflix-project
Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Netflix data using Python. It involves comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover key insights about Netflix's content library, including trends in titles, genres, release years, and more. The aim is to provide a deep understanding of the Netflix catalog through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Key Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
